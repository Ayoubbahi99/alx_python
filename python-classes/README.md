   * Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
   * size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
   * if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
   * Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
