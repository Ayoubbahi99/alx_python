Python - Functions

There are seven projects that will help me improve my python skills.

_ 0. a + b: function that add two numbers
_ 1. a ^ b: function that computes a to the power of b
_ 2. Temperature Converter Function: function called convert_to_celsius that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and returns the temperature in Celsius.
_ 3. String Manipulation Function: function called reverse_string that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.
